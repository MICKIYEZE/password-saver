**Welcome to my passwords saver!**

**The Idea:**

Passwords, are a daily neccesity we all need, eather
for your phone or you Computer.​

Writing the saved passwords in a book is also not an
option (in my opinion). The most convenient option (in
my opinion) is saving it on a computer you use daily,
but just writing them in a notes app is also not the
best solution since it's nice to keep them organized.​

Password manager, Organized, Easy to access.​

This is where my program comes in!

**What my program does:**

My program takes the passwords you entered and
saves them in a JSON file for easy access.​

Adding new passwords is also easy just launch the
program with the –add and it will take you to the
password adding menu.​

Launching the program by default (go run .) will just
show you the list of passwords without taking you to
the password adding option

**Features:**

- Passwords are saved in a JSON file (nice and neat)​

- The notes feature, Add additional notes to your saved
password!​

- Saved passwords accesible on the next program launch!
Say for example you saved a couple passwords and
restarted your pc... Your saved passwords are still there!​

*Warning:* The saved passwords are saved on your hard
drive, if someone gets access to it then the JSON file
with the passwords is also accesible to them!
